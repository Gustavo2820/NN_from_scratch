# NN_from_scratch
This repository contains an implementation of a neural network built from scratch using Python. The project focuses on creating a feedforward neural network to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Features
- Feedforward neural network built from scratch without using high-level libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
- Trains on the MNIST dataset (handwritten digits).
- Supports multiple hidden layers and activation functions.

## Requirements
Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install numpy```
Additionally, you will need to manually download the MNIST dataset since it is too large to be uploaded to this repository.Download the MNIST dataset:
1.Download the MNIST dataset:
Visit https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv and download the mnist_train.csv and mnist_test.csv files. After downloading, unzip and place the files in a folder named mnist-dataset/ within the project directory.
